    - libpthread has gone along with all the bugs associated with it.

    - Signal handling should now be indistinguishable from running
      natively. (Closes: #230785, #252520)
    - Valgrind is built in Position Independent Executable (PIE) format
      if the toolchain supports it.  This allows it to take advantage

      address spaces. (Closes: #272270, #288640)
  * debian/debian.supp:

       wasn't able to obtain the relevant name.

    type from comparison is too small to handle result of unsigned int
    subtraction.
  * debian/patches/02_sbbl.dpatch: New. gcc sometimes generates "sbbl
    %reg,%reg" to convert the carry flag into 0 or -1 in reg.  This has no
    actual dependency on reg, but memcheck can't see that, and so will help 
    if reg contains garbage.
  * debian/valgrind.1: 
    + s/--logfile-fd/--log-fd/
    + s/--logfile/--log-file/
    + s/--logsocket/--log-socket/

valgrind (1:2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - This version contains some internal structural changes needed for
      valgrind's long-term future.  These don't affect end-users.
      It closes: #230785, #221413
    - Greater isolation between Valgrind and the program being run, so
      the program is less likely to inadvertently kill Valgrind by doing
      wild writes.
    - Massif: a new space profiling tool. It will tell you in detail where
      and when your C/C++ code is allocating heap.
      Draws pretty .ps pictures of memory use against time. A potentially
      powerful tool for making sense of your program's space use.
    - Fixes for many bugs, including support for more SSE2/SSE3 instructions,
      various signal/syscall things, and various problems with debug info
      readers. (closes: #221659)
    - glibc 2.3.2 w/NPTL is massively different than what valgrind expects.
    - It now fully supports sysinfo page in 2.6 kernels.
      (closes: #217736, #227894, #229706, #230198)
  * The following patches has been updated:
    12_ipc_stuff.dpatch renamed to 01_ipc_stuff.dpatch.
    07_more_sem.dpatch renamed to 01_more_sem.dpatch.
    10_ansi-vg.dpatch.
    11_exitcode.dpatch.
  * The following patches has been removed. They are already on the
    upstream package:
    10_vg_stabs2.dpatch.
    01_vg_symtab2.c.dpatch.
    09_vg_stabs.dpatch.
    10_epoll.dpatch.
  * The following patches has been removed. They are useless or deprecated:
    01_include-Makefile.am.dpatch.
    01_include-Makefile.in.dpatch.
    01_watchpoints.dpatch.
    06_vg_include.h.dpatch.
    10_timestamp.dpatch.
    02_stack_addresses.dpatch.
  * debian/valgrind.doc: Removed PATCHES_APPLIED from the list.
  * debian/valgrind.default: Updated. Now you can especify valgrind options
    with VALGRIND_OPTS enviroment variable instead of VGOPTS.
  * debian/overrides: Added some overrides.
  * debian/valgrind.sh: Updated. Removed LD_ASSUME_KERNEL variable. Now it
    should handle things well. Besides, it will use memcheck as the default as
    now valgrind does not assume a default tool to use.

valgrind (1:2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Removed the following patches (already included in main source):

      on exit.

 -- Cyrille Chepelov <cyrille@chepelov.org>  Sun, 21 Jul 2002 17:26:16 +0200

valgrind (1.0pre2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * removed call to dh_strip, at upstream's request
  * Added an override against unstripped-binary-or-object, after shaleh gave
  green light.

valgrind (1.0pre2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Should hopefully close #150588.
  
  * installs file valgrind.h into /usr/include  (Closes: #147718). In
    fact, install now uses 'make install' which has been available for a
    while.

valgrind (0.0.20020511-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Should close #145554; waiting for feedback
    before closing this bug.

valgrind (0.0.20020503b-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a "local" suppressions file in the default conffile (Closes
    #145691 a more complete way without code-level changes).

valgrind (0.0.20020503b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. This one fixes a major bug from the last two
    snapshot packages (20020428 and 20020502).

  * added forgotten new binary libpthead.so (Closes: #145738)
  
  * Added a note in README.Debian about problems with running kernel 2.2
    with a binary built using kernel 2.4 (see #145554, which is not fixed yet).
  
  * Added a suppression for "ls -l" (Closes: 145727) and added a
    "debian.supp" temporary suppressions file. These suppressions should
    all be temporary, until upstream merges them.
  
  * Added a file, /etc/default/valgrind, which allows you to tweak
    default options for valgrind and cachegrind; in particular, the
    default suppressions file. (Closes: #145691)
  
  * Updated the control file to reflect the new features (libpthread,
    cachegrind)

valgrind (0.0.20020502-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Fixed description grammar/typography (Closes: #145311)
  
  * Fixed suppressions file generation. Now the package ships with "woody"
    and "potato" suppressions files (unconditionally uses "woody.supp" by
    default). (Closes: #145445)
  
  * Added a hint in README.Debian about the possibility to use the
    debugging libc6.

valgrind (0.0.20020428-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  
  * This package now works only with glibc-2.2 (upstream also supports 
  glibc-2.1)

 -- Cyrille Chepelov <cyrille@chepelov.org>  Tue, 30 Apr 2002 07:30:04 +0200

valgrind (0.0.20020329-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: added a build-dependency against glibc-2.2 (prevents
    attempts to build on potato; previous libc6-dev lacked a #define
    IPC_64 in linux/ipc.h). This again suggested by Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn.

  * Reviewed the upgrading checklist, and bumped up the Standards-Version
    accordingly.

valgrind (0.0.20020329-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: better cleaned up ./configure-generated files (used
    distclean rather than clean).
  * valgrind.1: removed a small inconsistency in the parameter
    documentation.
  
  Both these issues were reported by Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn

valgrind (0.0.20020329-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

valgrind (0.0.20020320-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. 
  * Fixed copyright file, which was lacking a mention of the GPL (oops).
  * added the README_MISSING_SYSCALL_OR_IOCTL docfile.

valgrind (0.0.20020226-2) unstable; urgency=low

    clone() are still unsupported. (Closes a comment from Joe Buck
    <Joe.Buck@synopsys.com>)
